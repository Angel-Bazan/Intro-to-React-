# Intro-to-React
React is a library  for handling your UI. UI stands for User interface. The stuff that the user sees and interacts with

### Why React? 

React has 3 things to think about and understand:
components: reusable bit of code that can be reuse throughout our application.Reusing same pieces everywhere and still have slight differientiations based on what we want. When the state changes the component reacts 
props: passes the components through the dom using props . starting with a color or an icon. Helps makes small changes . Arguments pass to our react components 
state: object that exist inside that component and when that state changes the component reacts and re-renders(turn that 17 to 18 or when someone is going live).  

### JSX
enables us to spit out the html that will eventually render to the DOM
